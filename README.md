This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation and demonstration of **HONet (Hierarchical Octave Network)**, a novel architecture that enables AI models to learn new skills sequentially **without catastrophic forgetting**.

## Core Concept: AI Without Amnesia

HONet solves the "plasticity-stability dilemma" by treating learned skills as immutable, foundational layers.

1.  **Isolate & Learn:** A task-specific `Octave` module (a conditional VAE) learns a single skill.
2.  **Freeze & Preserve:** The module's weights are frozen, guaranteeing its knowledge is never lost.
3.  **Distill & Summarize:** The Octave's *function* is distilled into a compact "Master-Tone" vector.
4.  **Condition & Build:** The next skill is learned by a new `Octave` conditioned on the previous Master-Tone, enabling positive knowledge transfer with **practical, linear `O(N)` scalability**.

This approach combines the perfect memory of architectural methods with a practical scaling law, making it ideal for building truly adaptive AI systems.

## Strong Proof of Capabilities

### 1. Zero Catastrophic Forgetting

HONet can learn new tasks without any degradation to its prior skills. This is the gold standard for continual learning.

*Figure 1: After learning a new task, HONet can still perfectly generate samples from a previously learned task.*

### 2. Linear Scalability

HONet's design avoids the `O(N^2)` parameter explosion of older methods like Progressive Neural Networks, making it viable for real-world systems that must learn many skills.

### 3. True Multi-Modal Generality

The HONet framework is data-agnostic. This demonstration shows a single HONet instance learning sequentially across three different data types: **Images (CNNs) -> Tabular Data (MLPs) -> Time-Series Data (LSTMs)**. It retains all three skills perfectly.
